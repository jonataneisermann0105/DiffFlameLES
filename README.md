# LES3D_TurbulentDiffusionFlame_MATLAB
This repository provides a MATLAB code for simulating turbulent diffusion flames at low Mach numbers using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The solver employs finite difference methods for spatial discretization and a projection-type algorithm for time integration. A companion article is under submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
